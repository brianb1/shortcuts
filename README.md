# Restart/Sleep/Logout/Shutdown/Lock

Five simple apps - that serve five simple purposes: restart, sleep, logout,
shutdown, lock.

## Why?

Once you have these apps installed locally, simply invoke spotlight (usually <kbd>command</kbd> `+` <kbd>space</kbd>), and start typing the name of one of these 5 "apps" / functions that you want to perform. Easy.
